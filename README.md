# Dragon-s-Keep
The repository for the Dragon's Keep discord bot. Coded in python3 and discord.py.

18/10/2022 | JavaScript Rewrite

In this section I will explain the JavaScript rewrite of this bot, including the reasons why I have chosen to rewrite the bot in another langauge.

Why am I rewriting in JavaSript?

I am rewriting the bot in JavaScript because I believe that I will be able to add more functionality to the bot this way. I also would prefer to use Mongo DB as opposed to the SQLite3 database currently used in the bot, this will provide better functionality to the bot when hosted, as the host I was using has issues with SQLite3 databases. 

What features will stay the same in the rewrite?

I plan to keep all of the cuurent features of the bot in the upcoming rewrite, as they are popular with my discord community and should be easy to convert over to the new language. As well as the features currently included in the bot, I will be adding some additional mini-games such as Blackjack! 

How long will the rewrite take?

I am expecting to have completed the rewrite in the next 3-4 months. 

What are the challenges I will face?

The challenges that I will face when undertaking this project are mostly easy problems to solve, such as learning the correct syntax for the JavaScript API and hooking up Mongo DB as this is a technology  I am yet to work with. 

How will I deal with these challenges?

I will deal with the challenges by reading the documentation for the JavaScript discord API and also for Mongo DB, referring to them once more when problems arise!

The future!

In the Future this README will be replaced with a fully detailed technical documentation for the bot, including a full explanation of the features and the code behind them, I simply changed it to this announcement so anybody reading this codebase for referrance would know that it will soon be changing over from Python to JavaScript meaning it may be a good idea to make a copy of the current codebase before it is archived upon completion of the rewrite.
